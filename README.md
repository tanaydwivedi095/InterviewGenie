# InterviewGenie

**InterviewGenie** is an advanced interview bot designed to:

- Ask intelligent and relevant questions to candidates.
- Score candidates based on their responses.
- Answer questions posed by the interviewee.

This project leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to create a dynamic and interactive interview process. It integrates multiple versions of trained models, scaling from smaller datasets to massive ones, ensuring adaptability and precision.

---

## Features

- **The model is able to answer the questions asked by the interviewee.**
- **The model is able to ask interviewee questions and assess the answer given by the interviewee uploaded in form of text or audio.**
- **Audio to Text Conversion:** Converts audio responses into text for scoring and evaluation.
- **Dynamic Questioning:** Generates interview questions tailored to the context.
- **Candidate Scoring:** Analyzes and scores candidate responses.
- **Interactive Q&A:** Answers candidate queries during the interview process.
- **Streamlit UI:** A user-friendly interface where users can drop questions and instantly receive answers.
- **Scalable Models:** Includes multiple model versions trained on datasets ranging from 23K tokens to 6.7M tokens.

### Upcoming Feature

- **3D Interviewer Avatar:** A 3D face representing an interviewer will be integrated for a more engaging and realistic experience.

## Note

If you want to increase the dataset, simply drop the PDF files into a folder named `Dataset`. The model will automatically process the new data.

## File Details

The repository contains the following files, representing different versions of the model:

1. **`InterviewBot_v1.ipynb`**: Model trained on 23K tokens.
2. **`InterviewBot_v2.ipynb`**: Model trained on 96K tokens.
3. **`InterviewBot_v3.ipynb`**: Model trained on 0.26M tokens.
4. **`InterviewBot_v4.ipynb`**: Model trained on 2.65M tokens.
5. **`InterviewBot_v5.ipynb`**: Model trained on 6.70M tokens.
6. **`ui.py`**: Streamlit UI for interacting with the bot.
7. **`Speech to Text.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook for converting audio responses to text.

Each file includes the full training pipeline, evaluation, and deployment logic for the respective version.

## Usage

### Streamlit UI

1. Run the Streamlit application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run ui.py
   ```
2. A browser window will open. Enter your question into the input field to receive an answer.

### Notebooks

1. Open the desired model file (e.g., `InterviewBot_v5.ipynb`) in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
2. Execute the cells step-by-step to:
   - Load the pre-trained model.
   - Initialize the RAG pipeline.
   - Interact with the bot.
3. Customize the bot's behavior, dataset, or scoring mechanisms as needed.

### Audio to Text Conversion

1. Open the `Speech to Text.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
2. Upload an audio file containing the interviewee's response.
3. Run the notebook to convert the audio to text.
4. Use the converted text for scoring and evaluation.
